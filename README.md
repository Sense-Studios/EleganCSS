**I've build elegancss because I was so fed up with all the other solutions**

I know.

### This is a work in progress

I have a soft spot for **Bootstrap**. I’ve been using it since its infancy, and I’m pretty sure I’ve dreamt in columns and containers on more than one pathetic occasion. 

But let’s be real: the world has moved on from the dark ages of `margin: auto` and sacrificial `float: left` hacks. With the arrival of **Flexbox** and **Grid**, the very fabric of CSS has shifted. We no longer need to be shackled to a rigid 12-column grid. We aren’t ancient Sumerians; if we want seven columns—or thirteen, just to watch the world burn—we can finally have them.

Sure, we still need styling, but who has the mental bandwidth to keep up with every "innovative" scrap the W3C has tossed out over the last five years? Native CSS functions drop monthly now, and browsers gobble them up with terrifying speed. Most of us would rather eat glass than read another pedantic article titled *"Five things you didn't know CSS could do"* or *"Are you still writing CSS like it's 2015?"* (Yes, we get it, you're very smart).

Still, wouldn't it be nice to have a modern CSS file you can just drop in? One that does almost everything Bootstrap does, but without the baggage of a thousand JavaScript dependencies?

### That is where ElegenCSS comes in.
It’s a drop-in solution for your CSS needs that requires exactly one configuration. It scavenges what was actually useful from Bootstrap and translates it into modern HTML standards for people who have better things to do with their lives.

* **Semantic HTML or Bust:** If you actually write decent code, the styling follows like a well-trained dog.
* **No more Div-Soup:** You can stop nesting `div` inside `div` just to align a simple horizontal form. It’s 2026; we’re better than that.
* **Smart Classes:** Slap the right class onto a `fieldset`, `section`, or the `form` itself, and it just works. No hassle, no drama.

**ElegenCSS** doesn't care about backward compatibility because it has no embarrassing backlog to defend. And don't worry about learning color theory; thanks to `oklch`, we just math out every derivative color you’ll ever need so you don't have to.
